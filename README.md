## vexptoolbox: A Python toolbox for VR behavioral experiments using Vizard

The *vexptoolbox* package aims to help researchers in implementing common tasks in behavioral experiments using the WorldViz Vizard VR platform. Current features include randomized, trial-based experimental designs, straightforward storing of result data to standardized file formats, and built-in recording of eye tracking and motion tracking data. 

This project began as a collection of common functionality that we encountered frequently when implementing behavioral VR experiments at [the Giessen University Perception and Action Lab](https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb06/psychologie/abt/allgemeine-psychologie/wh). It is a work in progress - please feel free to report any bugs you find or feature suggestsions using the Issues tool or provide a Pull Request! A manuscript describing this toolbox is currently in preparation and will be linked here after peer-review. 



## Documentation

A proper documentation website is in the works. Until then, take a look at the *examples* folder, which includes a growing list of example scripts that showcase common functionality. 

There is also a Github repository containing an [example VR experiment implemented using this toolbox](https://github.com/ischtz/proantireach-vizard) (pro-/anti-reaching paradigm), including sample data and analysis examples.
