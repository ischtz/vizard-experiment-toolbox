## vexptoolbox: A Python toolbox for VR behavioral experiments using Vizard

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/vexptoolbox.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/vexptoolbox)

The *vexptoolbox* package aims to help researchers in implementing common tasks in behavioral experiments using the WorldViz Vizard VR platform. Current features include randomized, trial-based experimental designs, straightforward storing of result data to standardized file formats, and built-in recording of eye tracking and motion tracking data. The code supports Vizard 6 (based on Python 2.7) and Vizard 7 (based on Python 3). 

This project began as a collection of common functionality that we encountered frequently when implementing behavioral VR experiments at [the Giessen University Perception and Action Lab](https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb06/psychologie/abt/allgemeine-psychologie/wh). It is a work in progress - please feel free to report any bugs you find or feature suggestsions using the Issues tool or provide a Pull Request! 

ðŸ“ƒ There is also a published [manuscript in Behavior Research Methods](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-022-01831-6) detailing the toolbox and example experiment!

## Installation

### Using the Vizard Package Manager

1. Open the [Vizard package manager](https://docs.worldviz.com/vizard/latest/#Package_Manager.htm) using *Tools > Package Manager* from the menu bar
2. Search for "vexptoolbox"

3. Select *Install*
    - In *Vizard 6*, the package manager will install and update the toolbox globally for all Vizard scripts
    - In *Vizard 7*, you will be able to install the package globally or only for the current script. The latter option will create a subfolder next to the currently selected script file but allow different packages and versions for each experiment.

4. Add an *import* statement at the top of your script, e.g. `import vexptoolbox as vx`

### Manual Installation

1. Clone a copy of the *vizard-experiment-toolbox* repository using ```git clone https://github.com/ischtz/vizard-experiment-toolbox.git``` or download using Github's "Download ZIP" functionality behind the "Code" button (upper right).
2. Copy the *vexptoolbox* subfolder to the folder containing your Vizard script
3. Add an *import* statement at the top of your script, e.g. `import vexptoolbox as vx`


## Documentation

A proper documentation website is in the works. Until then, take a look at the *examples* folder, which includes a growing list of example scripts that showcase common functionality. 

There is also a Github repository containing an [example VR experiment implemented using this toolbox](https://github.com/ischtz/proantireach-vizard) (pro-/anti-reaching paradigm), including sample data and analysis examples.
